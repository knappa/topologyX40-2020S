True or false: The derived set of every set is a closed set. 

\end{question}

\begin{proof}

True

\bigbreak

Let $(X, T)$ be a topological space, $A \subset X$, and $A'$ the derived set of $A$. Let $p \in X$ and suppose $p$ is a limit point of $A'$. Then $\forall S \in T$ with $p \in S$, $\exists x \in A'$ such that $x \in S$. It follows that $\exists y \in A$ such that $y \in S \  \forall S \in T$ with $p \in S$. So $p$ is a limit point of $A$ and hence is in $A'$. So $A'$ is closed. 

\end{proof}
