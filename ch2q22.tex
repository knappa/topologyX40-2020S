\begin{question}[Fasano]
Let $X$ be the plane. For each positive real number $a$, define $B_a=\{(x,y):3x-a<y<3x+a\}$. Show that the collection $\mathbf{B}=\{B_a:a>0\}$ is a base for a topology on the plane. Find the closure of the singleton set consisting of the origin.
\end{question}

\begin{proof}
    We consider $B_a=\{(x,y):3x-a<y<3x+a\}$. Then we have \newline \centering $3x-a<y<3x+a$ \newline \centering $-a<y-3x<a$ \newline \centering $|y-3x|<a$. \newline Therefore, for any given point $(x_0,y_0)\in X$ we can use the above inequality to find an $a$ such that $(x_0,y_0)\in B_a$. \newline Next we assume $p\in B_{a_1} \cap B_{a_2}$. Without loss of generality, we can assume $a_1<a_2$. Then $B_{a_1}\cap B_{a_2}=B_{a_2}$ ($B_{a_1}\cap B_{a_2}=B_{a_1}$ if $a_1>a_2$). Thus, $p\in B_{a_2}\subset B_{a_1}\cap B_{a_2}$. Therefore, $\mathb{B}$ is a basis for a topology on the plane. 
    \newline We next wish to find the closure of the singleton set containing the origin. That is, we wish to find the smallest closed set that contains ${(0,0)}$. It is clear that each $B_a$ is an open set. Thus the only closed sets of the topology are the complements of these elements. But each $B_a$ also contains the origin so none of the complements contain the origin. Thus, the smallest closed set that contains the origin must be all of $X$.
\end{proof}
