\begin{question}[Macula]

Suppose $i \colon (X, \bf T) \rightarrow (X, \bf S)$ is the identity function; that is, $i(x) = x$ for every $x \in X$. Prove that $i$ is continuous if and only if $\bf S \subset \bf T$. 

\end{question}

\begin{proof}

Suppose $\bf S \subset \bf T$. Then the preimage of every open set is open, hence $i$ is continuous. Suppose $i$ is continuous. Then the preimage of every open set is open, so every $S \in \bf S$ is in $\bf T$, hence $\bf S \subset \bf T$.

\end{proof}
