\begin{question}[Macula]

(a) In a pseudometric space $(X, d)$, can it ever happen that a cell $C(x; r)$ is a closed set? Explain.
\bigbreak
(b) Can it ever happen that $B(x; r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) \leq r\}$ is an open set?

\end{question}

\begin{proof}
(a) Yes. Let X be a set and let $d$ be the trivial pseudometric. Then for any $r > 0$, $C(x; r) = X$, hence is closed. 
\bigbreak
(b) Yes. Let X be a set and let $d$ be the trivial pseudometric. Then for any $r > 0$, $B(x; r) = X$, hence is open. 

\end{proof}
