\begin{question}[Fernandez]
  Let $X$ be the space of real numbers with the usual topology, and let $\mathbb{Q}$ be the subspace of rational numbers. Let $A=\{r\in\mathbb{Q}:0<r<1\}$, $B=\{r\in\mathbb{Q}:0<r\leq\sqrt{2}\}$, $C=\{r\in\mathbb{Q}:-\sqrt{2}\leq r\leq\sqrt{2}\}$. For each of the sets $A$, $B$, and $C$, tell whether in the subspace topology it is open, closed, or neither.
\end{question}
    
\begin{proof}
  $A$ is an open subspace. For any point $a\in A$ I can create an open neighborhood around $a$ which is the whole space $A$. $B$ is also an open subspace. Since $\sqrt{2}$ is not a rational number for any point $b\in B$ I can create a interval around $b$ say with radius $|\sqrt{2}-b|$ that is open within $B$. $C$ is also an open interval given a similar argument to $B$.
\end{proof}
