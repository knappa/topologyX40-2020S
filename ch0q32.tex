Then let $A$ be the set of elements such that$Z_m = \{ 0,..., m-1 \}$ and $B$ be the set of elements such that $Z_n = \{ 0,...,n-1 \}$. Then $Z_{n+m} = \{ 0, ..., n-1, n, ..., n+m-1 \}$ which has cardinality of$n+m$. Now for each element $b \in B$ we can map it directly to itself in$Z_{m+n}$. For each $a \in A$ we can map each element to itself $+n$ in $Z_{n+m}$.So each element in $Z_{n+m}$ is mapped to by either some $a\in A$ or $b\in B$.Since $A$ and $B$ are disjoint no element in $Z_{n+m}$ is mapped to by both some$a$ and $b$. Hence there is a one to one mapping between $Z_{n+m}$ and $A \cup B$. Therefore $A \cup B$ has cardinality $m+n$.\end{proof}%%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex%%% TeX-master: "main"%%% End:
